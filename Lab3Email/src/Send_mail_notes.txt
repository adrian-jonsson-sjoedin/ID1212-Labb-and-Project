1. Connect to the mail server
2. Send the EHLO command to the server
3. Start the STARTTLS protocol
4. Need to upgrade the socket to a secure socket and send the EHLO command again
5. Login using the AUTH LOGIN command. Need to send username and password using Base 64 encoding

We're now connected and can start sending an email
6. Use the MAIL FROM command to specify who the mail is from
7. Use the RCPT TO command to specify who to send the email to
8. Use the DATA command to start the transfer of the message contents, i.e., the headers and then the
message. After that the DATA command has been sent to the server from the client, the server will
respond with a 354 reply code. After that, the message contents can be transferred to the server.
When all message contents have been sent, a single dot (“.”) must be sent in a line by itself.
If the message is accepted for delivery, the SMTP server will response with a 250 reply code.
