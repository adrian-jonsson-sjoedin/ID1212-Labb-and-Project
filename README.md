The project is a springboot project developed in Intellij ultimate and uses a local MySQL 8 database which needs to be set up. 
Simply create a local database and then make a copy of the application-template.properties file, name it application.properties and follow the instructions from the template.

Then before running the project insert a user with admin acces in the user table. 
Set the username to whatever you want but use this password:$2a$10$3svT6hNcgJ8wxKuD6FJd1uT0CsLAItE/ufaQLAchQbKI1glpug9Ua

You can now run the project and login with your choosen username and the password admin. It is highly recommended to create a new user with admin access and a stronger password straight away and then delete this user.
